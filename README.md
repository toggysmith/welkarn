# Generating Documentation

Welkarn uses Doxygen to generate documentation. Follow [Doxygen's](https://www.doxygen.nl/download.html) instructions to download Doxygen. Then navigate to the `docs` directory and run the command `doxygen Doxyfile` in a terminal to generate a HTML and Latex version of the documentation.
